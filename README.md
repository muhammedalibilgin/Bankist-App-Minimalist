# Bankist-App-Minimalist

(I created this site while following Jonas Schmedtmann javascript course. I created it by examining it line by line.)

In this application, I simulated a banking application that I assumed consisted of 4 customers. These;
1) Jonas Schmedtmann => user:js pin:1111
2) Jessica Davis=>  user:js pin:2222
3) Steven Thomas Williams => user:stw pin:3333
4) Sarah Smith => user:ss pin:444
(With this information you can login and see the user interface.)

In this application, these 4 people can transfer money between them or can get a loan. The UI will be updated immediately afterwards. 

Thanks to this application, I learned the following; use and sorting of arrays, some javascript methods.
